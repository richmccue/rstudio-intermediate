Tips before you start. If you havenâ€™t done so already, please do the following:
-   Pull up documentation for a function by executing `?function` in the Console.
-   Install LaTeX in RStudio:
    ```
    install.packages('tinytex')
    tinytex::install_tinytex()
    ```

We will create a report as a PDF file. The process is similar for html or docx documents.
-   Open RStudio, click **File -> New File -> RMarkdown...**
-   Enter title, author, and select the type of output format **PDF** and click **OK**
-   The Markdown document with some example code will appear on your Editor window.
